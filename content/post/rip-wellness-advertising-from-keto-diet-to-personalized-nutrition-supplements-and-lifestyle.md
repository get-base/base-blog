Back in 2017 I heard of this diet that would help me achieve my goals at work, eliminate brain fog, upgrade my workouts and lose some weight. Pretty amazing right? Probably you have heard about this one too, the Keto diet.

Just like everyone else, I want to feel great and be energetic. I also wanted to lose some weight., But after trying Keto, I felt like something was off. I wasn't sick--I just wasn't at my best. In order to figure out what was going on, I had to go to the doctor, then go to a lab, fill out endless questionnaires, wait 20 days for my results, which I had to get in person during a workday.

It turns out I had hormonal imbalances and cholesterol problems on top of that. It took me many many days, copays, hidden bills, doctor’s opinions and many hours of research on Google to learn what was wrong and come up with a new diet that would fix my current issues… there had to be a better way than this.

## **Fitness trackers for better sleep and workouts?**

One of my approaches to start understanding my body better and to stay motivated was to buy a Fitbit. In my head that was committing to a better lifestyle. If I invested that money that meant that I would have to workout, that I would figure out how to sleep better, that I would optimize my workouts… etc. a wonderful world right?

Except… it was not helping me to understand why sometimes I was waking up tired or what I should eat before or after a workout to prevent injuries. One day it ran out of battery and it is still waiting for me on my nightstand. I went through the honeymoon phase with my fitness tracker, cool graphs, motivational messages etc. but nothing to help me eat better fats or prevent brain fog.

After that, soon I realized that if I would have had access to my data I would have discovered what was going on with my body early on. It is really hard to _feel_ and know when your cholesterol is off or your Vitamin D levels are low. What you don’t measure, you don’t truly know and you can’t truly fix by diet or supplemental changes.

We’ve known for a long time that spotting and fixing health issues before they turn into irreversible problems leads to longer, healthier lives but the motivation to do so is non-existent. Why? Because it’s hard to know what really matters and what not. A WHO study that dates all the way back to the 1980s has shown that only about 10% of our health depends on genetics, while 70% depends on lifestyle choices. That means you can have control over this 70% but how?

The current healthcare system is designed to diagnose and treat sickness but not to track and fix when something is off: fatigue, stomach issues, irritability, sleep quality, brain fog, weight loss etc. If you go to the doctor and tell them that you are anxious or tired but not sick they will likely send you to other specialists outside of the core healthcare system that will cost you thousands of dollars, and will be slow to get data and solutions. People tend to blame themselves for these things when the answer could actually be in their blood. Something that I experienced myself.

## **No more fake promises on fad diets, expensive supplements or wellness gurus**

At Base we want to create a system that’s:

* Accessible: test at the comfort of home or walk-in to a Quest diagnostics and get your sample taken in 10 minutes. Receive results directly on your phone 5 days later. No doctor visits, all managed from your app.
* Affordable: taking a test should have a clear price tag and should not be hundred of dollars, copays, etc. At Base we work hard to improve labs operations to reduce costs, automate some of the decision process to make doctors quicker to prescribe and review tests and to cut out the middle man.
* Actionable: Know what your results mean, how are they impacting your life and have the tools to improve them. If your Cortisol levels are low, you might be vitamin deficient — with Base you’ll know exactly how to fix that.
