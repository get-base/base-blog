Are you feeling tired all the time even when you got plenty of sleep? There are some things that you can do to help yourself feel better and to boost your energy! These tips are simple and may help you feel your best so that you can make it through that afternoon slump and power through work, time with kids, errands or whatever you may need to get done.

**1. Exercise first thing in the morning**

Exercising first thing in the morning gives you a boost of energy that may last through the day. Something as simple as taking a walk outside will help you wake up a bit to have enough energy to start your day. Physical activity gets your heart rate up and gets your blood flowing which releases endorphins to raise your energy levels.

**2. Make sure you're getting enough vitamin D**

Vitamin D plays a huge role in energy levels and many people are vitamin D deficient, especially those who live in areas that are cold without a lot of sunlight most of the year. Vitamin D can be found in foods such as fish, egg yolks and many fortified foods. Vitamin D supplements can be very effective in boosting vitamin D levels as well as getting as little as 20 minutes of sunlight on your skin each day.

Your body produces vitamin D using energy from sunlight and is very important in the body. Having adequate vitamin D levels improves muscle function and can improve energy levels from within the cells. Optimal vitamin D levels are 30 ng/ml and having slightly reduced vitamin D levels from 21-29 ng/ml can make you feel more tired.

  
**3. Don't overdo the caffeine**

Although when you are tired, you may feel like having a bunch of coffee or other caffeinated beverages, do not overdo it because it may make you feel worse. If you are truly tired, the caffeine will not really help and may make you crash worse once the effects of the caffeine wear off. Having a cup or two of coffee in the morning or a cup in the afternoon is fine but don't go crazy drinking a pot of coffee. Choose a time that you're not going to have any caffeine after so that you can fall asleep easily at night. Noon works for some people and some people are okay with having a coffee at 3 PM. Choose what works for you.

**4. Move for a few minutes mid-day**

Getting a few minutes of movement mid-day can be extremely helpful to boosting your energy. If you work at an office type job especially, you may feel pretty tired from sitting around. Getting up and doing a bit of exercise will help give you a boost of energy to help get you through the rest of your day. Do some jumping jacks, squats, planks, pushups, etc. Just 5 minutes will get your heart rate up and increase your energy.

  
**5. Eat nutrient rich foods**

Although your body may be craving junk food when you are sleep deprived, it is not what it actually wants. Instead, have whole grains which gives you a steady supply of energy instead of spiking your blood sugar quickly and then crashing like sugar or refined grains will do. Oatmeal in the morning is a great choice or a whole-grain piece of toast with peanut butter for a snack. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables provides vitamins to help you make sure that you're meeting your nutrient needs to feel your best.

**6. Stay hydrated**

It almost seems hard to believe but if you are dehydrated, it can make you feel more tired. Keep a reusable bottle of water filled up and sip it through the day. Bring it in the car wherever you go and drink, drink, drink. Dehydration has so many negative side effects that you want to make sure you're staying well-hydrated all day long.

**7. Stick to a reasonable bedtime**

You're not going to have enough energy if you do not sleep well. Choose a bedtime that works for you and stick to it as much as possible. Limit being on your phone or watching TV right before bed if that seems to interfere. Make a bedtime routine for yourself that is calming such as reading before bed, having a cup of herbal tea or relaxing with your significant other.
